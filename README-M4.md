# Unit 4 Challenge: Console Finances

## Overview

This unit was a real challenge for me and I had to think out of the box with this one. I spend all of my Saturday looking at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript for different ways to work out the diffent ways to I could use varaibles within varibles.

As you can see in the screenshot above I have used the MATH namespace to work with numbers. REDUCE and also SLICE array.

### Conculsion

I found this weeks module more of a challenge than the last three weeks. This has been a great test to actually search and review different types of arrays and elements to use.

I also found I liked to test and change code more with Javascript.
